## Design a Drop Down Menu
### Events and State Design Process
1. identify what interaction the webstie should display aftering taking the user
input
2. group differet reaction into two categories (state or event handler)
3. generalize the steps with similar functionalities
4. write a simple text function to check if the props can work as intended
    - can simplify by removing the components that are not changing
    - then replace the remaining action with some text description
    - come up with an event handler function that can reflect on user input
5. figure out where to define the component by thinking about the props flow
